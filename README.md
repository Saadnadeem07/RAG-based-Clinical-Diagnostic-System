# üß¨ ClinicalRAG: Gemini-Powered Clinical Document Search with MIMIC-III

**ClinicalRAG** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that leverages **Gemini Pro** to enable natural language querying over the **MIMIC-III** clinical dataset. It empowers healthcare practitioners and researchers to interactively search and reason over real-world ICU records using state-of-the-art large language models.

---

## üîç Overview

This project integrates:

- **MIMIC-III Dataset**: A de-identified database of over 60,000 ICU admissions.
- **Gemini Pro**: A multimodal large language model for contextual reasoning and response generation.
- **RAG Architecture**: Combines semantic search via vector embeddings with generative answering using Gemini.

## üöÄ Features

- Upload or use built-in MIMIC-III clinical notes
- FAISS-powered semantic search on clinical note embeddings
- Gemini Pro generates detailed, contextual responses to medical queries
- Intuitive Streamlit web interface for real-time interaction

## üß† How It Works

1. **Embedding**: Clinical notes are embedded using Google‚Äôs text embedding model.
2. **Indexing**: FAISS is used to index and retrieve the most relevant note chunks.
3. **RAG Pipeline**: Retrieved chunks and the user‚Äôs query are passed to Gemini for final response generation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clinicalrag.git
cd clinicalrag
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Gemini API Key

Set your Gemini API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

> On Windows (CMD):

```cmd
set GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### 4. Launch the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## üí° Example Queries

Here are some examples of natural language queries you can ask:

* *What medications were given during the ICU stay?*
* *Did the patient show signs of pneumonia?*
* *What was the discharge diagnosis?*
